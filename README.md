# Rshiny_webapp
Creation of a web application to perform phylogenetic-related analysis and pathogens transmission simulation.

Please notice that this is still an ongoing project and that some bugs might impede the user experience. 
You will have to change some the repository description within each of the R file in order to use the application locally. 

If you have any question feel free to contact me. 

Regards, 

Florian Duchatel
